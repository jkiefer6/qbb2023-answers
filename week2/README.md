1.1 1 Mbp * 3x coverage = 3Mbp total; 3 million bp/100 bp = 30,000 reads
1.3.1 50,641 bases have 0 coverage or 5.0641% of the genome has zer coverage.
1.3.2 This fits the poisson expectations which suggest that the area with zero coverage should be about 50,000 and the Poisson distribution fit the curve well. The normal distrbution fits the simulationa bit worse than the Poisson becasue the normal distribution fits less well for smaller means (ie smaller coverage). If we increase the coverage than we should see that the fit of normal distribution would improve. 
1.4.1 There are 52 bases with zero coverage or 0.0052% of the genome
1.4.2 The Poisson distribution fits the curve well, better than the 3x coverage. Similarly, the normal distrbution fits the simulation slightly worse than the Poisson becasue the normal distribution fits less well for smaller means (ie smaller coverage). But the normal distribution fits the simulation much better than for 3x coverage.
1.5.1 There are 9 bases with zero coverage or 0.0009% of the genome.
1.5.2 Both the normal distribution and the Poisson distribution fit the simulation very well. This is becasue the increased coverage leads to increased means and lamda which contributes to the distributions fitting very well to the simualtion.

Title: The Significance of Genomics for Cell and Molecular Biologists: A Protein-Centric Perspective

Introduction

Cell and molecular biology, as fields of scientific exploration, have long been concerned with deciphering the intricate mechanisms that govern cellular processes. For cell and molecular biologists, proteins and cell signaling pathways have traditionally occupied the forefront of research. However, in the era of modern biology, genomics has emerged as a crucial companion to these disciplines, offering new insights and tools that are indispensable to understanding the complexities of cellular functions. This essay explores why a cell and molecular biologist with a focus on proteins and cell signaling should take a keen interest in genomics, demonstrating how genomics can provide a broader context and deeper understanding of cellular processes.

Genomics: The Blueprint of Life

Genomics is the comprehensive study of an organism's entire genome, which encompasses all of its genetic material, including genes, non-coding DNA, and regulatory elements. Genomes serve as the blueprint of life, containing the instructions for the synthesis of proteins, the fundamental building blocks of cells. Understanding the genome is akin to reading the operating manual for a biological system, and it forms the foundation upon which molecular and cellular biology are built.

Protein-Coding Genes: At the core of genomics lies the identification and characterization of genes that encode proteins. For a cell and molecular biologist focused on proteins, genomics provides a valuable resource for identifying new genes and potential protein targets. High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing, allow for the discovery of novel genes and their alternative splicing patterns, shedding light on previously uncharted territories of the proteome.
Functional Annotations: Genomics doesn't merely stop at gene identification; it also offers functional annotations. Through databases like UniProt, GenBank, and Ensembl, cell and molecular biologists can access detailed information about protein-coding genes, including their functions, domains, and interactions. This wealth of data aids in the selection of candidate proteins for further study.
Regulatory Elements: Genomic research extends beyond protein-coding genes. Non-coding regions of the genome, such as enhancers and promoters, play pivotal roles in the regulation of gene expression and cell signaling. By exploring genomics, cell and molecular biologists can unravel the intricate web of regulatory elements that control when and where genes are expressed, enriching our understanding of cellular responses to various stimuli.
Evolutionary Insights: Genomics provides an evolutionary context for proteins and signaling pathways. Comparative genomics allows researchers to trace the origins and evolution of specific protein families and cellular processes. This information is invaluable for discerning the conserved core elements of signaling pathways and identifying species-specific adaptations.
Disease Mechanisms: Genomic studies have unraveled the genetic underpinnings of many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and rare genetic diseases. Understanding the genomic alterations associated with these conditions is paramount for developing targeted therapies and diagnostic tools, a perspective highly relevant to cell and molecular biologists aiming to combat diseases at the molecular level.
Personalized Medicine: The advent of genomics has paved the way for personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to an individual's genetic makeup. As cell and molecular biologists delve into the intricacies of cellular processes, genomics offers the potential to identify patient-specific genetic variations that may influence drug responses, allowing for more effective and personalized treatment strategies.
Conclusion

In the pursuit of unraveling the mysteries of cellular functions, a cell and molecular biologist's journey is far from complete without embracing genomics. Genomics serves as an indispensable companion, providing a holistic perspective that complements the protein-centric focus of cell and molecular biology. It offers a comprehensive view of an organism's genetic landscape, from protein-coding genes to regulatory elements, and extends beyond by illuminating evolutionary histories and disease mechanisms.

To excel in the study of proteins and cell signaling, it is essential to appreciate how these elements fit into the broader genomic context. By integrating genomics into their research toolkit, cell and molecular biologists gain a deeper understanding of the cellular processes they investigate and are better equipped to contribute to advancements in science and medicine.

3.2 I would not have used the phrase "fields of scientific exploration" as it sounds pompous and not descriptive. I also would not have used "this essay explores" because I absolutely hate when people introduce papers this way. It's not compelling and it restates the basics in a way that detracts from your own authority as an author. By stating "this essay" you are just restating the obvious and using a sentence structure that detracts from the general flow of writing (sorry in advance about how picky I am, I'm an English minor). I would have preferred something along the lines of: recent advances in the fields have revealed how important genomcis is for x, y, and z aspects of cell research. Also the general sentence structure/flow of the "thesis" sentence is just in general awkward. I will note that I've edited many papers where people use this kind of structure and languange. I actually like the phrase "akin to reading the operating manual for a biological system" as its a nice general comparison that I think would appeal to a general audeince (not an audience of scientists). Also the sentence "Genomic studies have unraveled the genetic underpinnings of many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and rare genetic diseases" is an overstatement at best about these diseases. I think this is actually misleading because it makes it sound like we've figured out how all of the diseases work (esp to a general audience) when that is just not true, though we have made many advances in genetics to udnerstand why and how such diseases can occur. Overall, not a terrible essay though the sections were lacking a lot of anyalsis. Also the citations linked at the bottom are not actually assigned to sentences in the essay which could be a fault of my prompt or because the AI can't recognize on its own that references need to be called in the text. I checked out the actual references:
1- an actual textbook, though the entire book is cited instead of passages
2- an actual review paper though the publication date was actuall in 2009 not 8 and the pages don't seem to be right; also not clear on what this has to do with the paper it's about big genmoics data sets but specifcally about the gaps in software development to analyze the data
3- this one is actually a paper from the group that developed Ensembl and this website is directly referenced in the essay
4- This paper also exists but the first author seems to be made up by ChatGPT and the publication date was in 2008 and not 2012. 
5- This paper exists and also seem pretty relevant to the essay
6- This paper does not exist and is entirely made up though JC Venter is an actual person that seems to have done some genomics work
